# JapaPolicy AI: Your Intelligent UK Immigration Assistant

## Quick Start (For Users)

JapaPolicy AI is a web application that provides cited, accurate answers to UK immigration questions by querying a comprehensive database of official GOV.UK PDF documents.

To run the application locally (after initial setup):

Activate your Python environment (aicerts).

Run the application from the project root:

```python
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 💡 What It Does

This project solves the problem of searching complex, hundreds-of-pages-long UK immigration documents. Instead of manually searching, you can ask a question in natural language (e.g., "Can I switch from a Graduate Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa?") and get a structured, reliable answer that cites the source PDF and page number.

### Key Features:

Grounded Answers: Responses are strictly based on official GOV.UK PDFs (Skilled Worker, Graduate, ILR rules, etc.).

Fast Retrieval: Uses a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that combines semantic and keyword search for high accuracy.

Dual Interface: Features a user-friendly Streamlit Web App (for conversational querying) and backend Python scripts (for indexing).

Quick Startup: The database is pre-built (using build_db.py) to ensure the Streamlit app launches quickly.

### 🛠️ Setup and Installation (For Developers)

This project requires Python 3.9+ and uses several external libraries for RAG, vector storage, and the UI.

### Prerequisites
Clone the repository:

```python
git clone [https://github.com/Ojey-egwuda/JapaPolicy-AI-UK-Immigration-Policy-Assistant]
cd JapaPolicy-AI-UK-Immigration-Policy-Assistant
```
Create and activate a virtual environment
```python
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
1. Create a file named .env in the project root.

2. Add your Google API key and desired model to the file:
```python
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
GOOGLE_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro"
```

3. Place all official GOV.UK PDF documents you wish to index into the data/ folder.

### Running the Application

1. Build the Database (Run ONCE or upon PDF update):
This critical step loads documents, chunks them, and generates embeddings for fast lookups. It may take 20+ minutes initially.
```python
python build_db.py
```

2.Launch the Web App:

Once the database build is complete, launch the Streamlit interface:
```python
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Your browser will open the JapaPolicy AI interface.
